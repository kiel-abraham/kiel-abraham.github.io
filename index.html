				<p class="time">Private repo</p>
				<p class="description">Building sites with GatsbyJS is amazing. I decided to build a management system that would allow me to speed up the creation process and then just populate content (or possibly just open it up for users). I wanted to build it in React and make it scalable so I built it with Google Firebase allowing for remote auth, database and functions. I then integrated the repo with Netlify via their API so that I could have continuous deployment when content is updated and keep it automated. The repo is currently private but happy provide access to code if desired.</p>

				<p class="description">I love playing music with my band and when I was doing my development course I had a project where I needed to hit some points. It had to be in PHP, have some CRUD capability and use Geolocation. I built a live gig event system. It would allow users to find gigs nearby and also had the functionality for admins to create and edit events. It was a great project and maybe one day I'll rebuild it with React.</p>
