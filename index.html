				<h3 class="title">THKR App (work in progress)</h3>
				<p class="time">Private repo</p>
				<p class="description">I was finding that I was really enjoying building sites with Gatsby. The result is a super fast static site and I get to build it with React! What I was finding though was I kept building very similar setups. I wanted to build a management system that would allow me to speed up the process and then just populate content (or possibly just open it up for users). I wanted to build it in React and make it scalable so I built it with Google Firebase. It has been a great learning project as well because with Firebase I get to run remote auth, database and functions. I then hooked it up to Netlify via their API so that I could have continuous deployment when content is updated and keep it automated. The repo is currently private but happy provide access to code if desired.</p>

				<p class="description">One day I was having a lot of trouble choosing between three items. A coin flip just wasn't going to work. After that I decided to build a simple React app to help make decisions easier. This app lets a user enter a few options and then click choose to have a decision.</p>

				<a class="time" href="https://github.com/kiel-abraham/go-listen-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github repo</a>
				<p class="description">I love playing music with my band and when I was doing my development course I had a project where I needed to hit some points. It had to be in PHP, have some CRUD capability and use Geolocation. I built a live gig event system. It would allow users to find gigs nearby and also had the functionality for admins to create and edit events. It was a great project and maybe one day I'll rebuild it with React.</p>
